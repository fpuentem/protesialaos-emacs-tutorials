"Boilerplate code" refers to sections of code that are repeated in
multiple places with little to no variation. This type of code is
often used in programming to provide a standard way of handling common
tasks or to set up an environment that is necessary for the
application to run.

Here are some key points about boilerplate code:

1. **Purpose**: Boilerplate code is used to streamline the development
   process by providing a foundation or template for common
   tasks. This can include setting up configuration files, defining
   standard functions, or initializing necessary components.

2. **Examples**: Common examples of boilerplate code include setting
   up the basic structure of a web application, defining a class in
   object-oriented programming, or writing the initial setup for a
   server. In HTML, the standard structure of a document with
   `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags is considered boilerplate.

3. **Advantages**:
   - **Consistency**: Boilerplate code helps maintain consistency
     across different parts of an application or different projects by
     providing a uniform starting point.
   - **Efficiency**: By reusing boilerplate code, developers can save
     time and reduce the likelihood of errors, as the code has often
     been tested and proven to work.
   - **Readability**: It can improve readability by making the code
     structure predictable and easier to understand for other
     developers.

4. **Disadvantages**:
   - **Redundancy**: Boilerplate code can lead to redundancy and
     increased codebase size, making maintenance more challenging.
   - **Complexity**: It can add complexity, especially if the
     boilerplate code includes many features or options that are not
     needed for every use case.
   - **Obsolescence**: If the underlying technology or best practices
     change, the boilerplate code may need to be updated across
     multiple projects, which can be time-consuming.

5. **Management**: To manage boilerplate code effectively, developers
   can use templates, code generators, or frameworks that include
   boilerplate as part of their setup. This approach helps automate
   the inclusion of necessary code and reduces manual duplication.

In summary, boilerplate code is a practical tool in software
development for establishing a standard approach to common
tasks. However, it's essential to manage it carefully to avoid the
pitfalls of redundancy and unnecessary complexity.

### The `add-hook` Function

In Emacs, a "hook" is a variable that holds a list of functions to be
called when a certain event occurs. The `add-hook` function is used to
add a function to a specific hook.

#### Syntax
```elisp
(add-hook HOOK FUNCTION &optional APPEND LOCAL)
```

- `HOOK`: The hook to which the function should be added. Hooks are usually named with a `-hook` suffix.
- `FUNCTION`: The function to be added to the hook.
- `APPEND`: If non-nil, the function is added to the end of the hook's list. Otherwise, it is added to the beginning.
- `LOCAL`: If non-nil, the function is added to the buffer-local value of the hook.

### Example in Your Code
```elisp
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'abbrev-mode)
```
- `text-mode-hook`: This is the hook that runs when `text-mode` is activated.
- `abbrev-mode`: This is the function to be added to `text-mode-hook`.

This line means that whenever `text-mode` is activated, `abbrev-mode` will also be activated automatically.

### Other Elements in Your Code

#### `my-current-time` Function
```elisp
(defun my-current-time ()
  (insert (format-time-string "%T")))
```
This defines a function called `my-current-time` which inserts the current time (formatted as hours:minutes:seconds) at the current point in the buffer.

#### Calling `my-current-time`
```elisp
(my-current-time)
;; 00:45:02
```
This calls the `my-current-time` function, inserting the current time at the point of invocation. In your example, it inserts `00:45:02`.

#### Defining an Abbreviation
```elisp
(define-abbrev global-abbrev-table "medyn" "" 'my-current-time)
```
This defines an abbreviation in the `global-abbrev-table`. When you type `medyn` and then type a word-terminating character (like space or punctuation), it expands to the result of the `my-current-time` function.

- `global-abbrev-table`: The global table for abbreviations.
- `"medyn"`: The abbreviation to be defined.
- `""`: The string to replace the abbreviation with, but here it's left empty because a function is used.
- `'my-current-time`: The function to call when the abbreviation is expanded.

### Summary

- `add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'abbrev-mode` ensures `abbrev-mode` is activated whenever `text-mode` is activated.
- The `my-current-time` function inserts the current time.
- The abbreviation `medyn` is defined to expand to the current time when typed, using the `my-current-time` function.
